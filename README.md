# Newton-Apple-Game-Scratch
I have created a game named Newton's Apple. Here you have to catch apples in order to score. If you catch red apple, you score 2 points. If you catch yellow apple, you score 5 points. If you catch donuts, you score reduced by 10 points. And if you catch dragon, you score reset to 0. You can move dinosaur left and right with left arrow key and right arrow key respectively. If your score is less than 0 then "Game Over".
